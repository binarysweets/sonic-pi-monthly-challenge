This months challenge is simply 5 minutes of live coding.

Instructions:

1. Live code for 5 minutes – That’s it!

2. You may use the built-in synths and samples or use external samples; it is up to you.
The style/genre is also up to you, but you must make the performance at least 5 minutes (10s either side will be okay)

3. Post the code and video links into this topic:
https://in-thread.sonic-pi.net/t/sonic-pi-monthly-challenge-5/
and tell us a little about your creative process.

**The deadline for this challenge is 28th February.**
