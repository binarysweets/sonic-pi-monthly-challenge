This months challenge is: Text > binary > music.

Instructions:

1. Choose a word, name or short phrase of text and convert it into binary code by using this website:
https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-to-binary.html

2. Take the converted binary code and use it to create a piece of music or live performance (using rings, bools, arrays, etc). Each loop should use a new word, name, phrase or part of the original converted binary code.
You may use the built-in synths and samples or use external samples; it’s up to you.
The length and genre is also up to you.

3. Post the code and audio links (Youtube/Soundcloud) into this topic.
Tell us what text you started with for each loop, and a little about your creative process.

**The deadline for this challenge is 31st January**
